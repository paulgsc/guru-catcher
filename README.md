# Risks of Sharing API Keys - IMO

> text generated by claudeai based on this prompt: someone created a saas called guru catcher that attempts to verify guru claims by having them share their stripe transactions publicly. This is the flow they setup, guru creates a api secret key with read only access, then pastes that key to the website form template. Site consumes it and generates a chart of total earned revenue. This had my head in a swivel, I'm hurt rn, I'm I being overdramatic?

- **Fundamental Security Violation**: Even with read-only access, sharing API keys goes against basic security principles. It's akin to giving someone a key to your house, even if you've locked some rooms.

- **Potential for Abuse**: While the key may be read-only, it still provides access to sensitive financial data. This could be misused for various purposes, including blackmail, competitive analysis, or social engineering attacks.

- **Scope Creep**: Today it might be read-only, but what if the service decides to expand its features? Users might forget they've shared this key and inadvertently grant more access than they initially intended.

- **Trust Issues**: The website is asking users to trust that they will handle the API keys securely. There's no guarantee that they're not storing these keys or using them for purposes beyond what's stated.

- **Normalization of Bad Practices**: This approach normalizes the sharing of API keys, which could lead to users being more cavalier with their security in other contexts.

- **Privacy Concerns**: Even if the data is aggregated, sharing detailed financial information is a significant privacy issue. It could lead to unintended consequences in personal and professional life.
  Stripe's Terms of Service: This practice likely violates Stripe's terms of service, which could lead to account suspension or termination for the "gurus" participating.
  Lack of Audit Trail: If something goes wrong, there's no way to track who accessed the data or how it was used, as the key is shared with a third party.
